# PenguinPT

# Description
  This a small toy pathtracer intented to render volumes along with meshes. It currently supports nanovdb volumes (density grid only), .obj format meshes (materials are not supported yet). There is not yet any user interface so you have to modify the code to change the loaded files, and compile.
  The nanovdb repository is not included in the package, you have to download openvdb and add it to your C: folder. You can build it if you want to but that's not necessary.

# Controls
  Press Z Q S D to move and space and shift to go up or down.

# Future features
  - Easier assets loading
  - Phase function for volumes
  - temperature grid
  - materials
  - XML mitsuba file format
  - Envmap
  - Setting for english keyboards
